## Date Range and Filters

- Most reports allow **From** and **To** dates. Choose a month, quarter, or custom range.
- Some reports use “as at” a single date (e.g. Balance Sheet). Use the same date as your external reports for comparison.

---

## Export and Print

- Use **Export** (e.g. PDF or CSV) when available to download or print.
- Export is useful for auditors, tax filings, and management packs.

---

## Scheduling (If Available)

- If your plan supports **scheduled reports**, set them up from the report screen or Settings so reports are generated and sent by email on a schedule (e.g. monthly).

---

## Accuracy and Reconciliation

- Reports are based on:
  - Journal entries (including opening balances)
  - Expenses and payments
  - Sales invoices and receipts
  - Bank and other ledger postings  
- Reconcile **bank** and **VAT** regularly so Trial Balance, P&L, and VAT reports match your expectations and external filings.
