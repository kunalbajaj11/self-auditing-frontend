## When Reporting an Issue

Include as much of the following as possible so support can help quickly:

1. **What you were doing** — e.g. “Creating an expense”, “Uploading bank statement”, “Running Trial Balance”.
2. **What happened** — e.g. “Upload failed”, “Wrong total”, “Button is disabled”.
3. **Expected result** — what you expected to see or do.
4. **User role** — Admin, Accountant, Employee, etc.
5. **Browser and device** — e.g. Chrome on Windows, Safari on Mac.
6. **Screenshot or error message** — if you see an error, copy the text or attach a screenshot (remove any sensitive data).
7. **Organization** — organization name or ID if support asks (do not share passwords or tokens).

## For Your Organization’s Admin

- **User and access issues:** Contact your organization’s **Admin** (User Management, roles, deactivation).
- **Billing and license:** Contact your **account manager** or the channel that provided your license (user limits, plan upgrade, expiry).
