# Account & Security Guide

This guide covers account access, passwords, and security best practices in SelfAccounting.AI.

---

## Logging In

- Use the **Sign In** link (e.g. from the homepage or `/auth/login`).
- Enter your **email** and **password**.
- You are then taken to your workspace (Admin, Accountant, or Employee) according to your role.

---

## Passwords

- **Minimum length:** Typically 8 characters (enforced at registration and when changing password).
- **Best practices:**
  - Use a strong, unique password (mix of letters, numbers, symbols).
  - Do not share your password.
  - Change it periodically and if you suspect it was exposed.

---

## Forgot Password

1. On the **login** page, click **Forgot Password** (or similar).
2. Enter your **email** and submit.
3. Check your inbox for a **password reset** link from SelfAccounting.AI.
4. The link expires after a short time (e.g. 1 hour). If it expired, request a new one.
5. Set a new password and confirm. Then log in with the new password.

---

## Session and Logout

- Stay logged in until you close the browser or click **Sign out** (in the app shell).
- **Sign out** when using a shared or public device so others cannot access your account.
- Sessions may expire after a period of inactivity; you will be asked to log in again.

---

## Role-Based Access

- Your **role** (Admin, Accountant, Employee, etc.) determines what you can see and do. See **User Roles & Permissions**.
- **Employees** see only their own expenses; **Admins** and **Accountants** see all organization data within the app.

---

## Organization and Data Isolation

- Each organization’s data is **isolated**. You only see data for the organization you belong to (except Super Admin, who manages the platform).
- Do not share your login with others; invite them as separate users with the correct role instead.

---

## Admins: User Management

- **Admins** can invite users, set roles, and deactivate accounts (Settings → User Management).
- Deactivate users who leave the organization so they can no longer log in.
- Use the minimum role needed (e.g. Employee for staff who only submit expenses).

---

## Security Best Practices

- Use a **strong, unique password** and change it if you suspect compromise.
- **Do not share** your password or leave yourself logged in on shared devices.
- **Sign out** when done on a shared computer.
- **Allowlist** or trust the SelfAccounting.AI email sender so password reset and alerts are not missed or marked spam.
- Report any suspicious activity or unexpected emails to your admin or support.

---

## Contact

- For **password or login** issues: use Forgot Password first; if that fails, contact your organization’s Admin or support.
- For **security concerns**: contact support@selfaccounting.ai or your account manager.
